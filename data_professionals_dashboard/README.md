# Data Professionals Dashboard

This is my first Power BI project where I analyze and visualize a survey dataset related to data professionals. The dashboard provides insights into various aspects of the survey data, such as years of experience, preferred tools, job satisfaction, and salary expectations.

## Project Overview

In this project, I used **Power BI** to create an interactive dashboard that displays key metrics and trends about data professionals. The data was analyzed to provide actionable insights that can help organizations make better decisions regarding recruitment, training, and talent management.

### Key Features:
- **Years of Experience**: Analyzed how experience influences job roles and salary expectations.
- **Preferred Tools**: Visualized the most commonly used tools in the data science field.
- **Salary Expectations**: Provided insights into average salaries based on years of experience and job roles.
- **Demographic Insights**: Identified trends among different regions and education levels.

## Tools Used:
- **Power BI Desktop**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Excel**: For data preprocessing and manipulation (if applicable).
- **Power Query**: For data transformation and cleaning.

## How to Use

1. **Open the Power BI Desktop file** (.pbix) to view and interact with the dashboard.
2. You can filter the data by various attributes such as experience level, role, and region to explore insights.
3. Hover over the visuals to view detailed data and trends.
